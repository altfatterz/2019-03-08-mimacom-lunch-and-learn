## Setup up locally

1. Start Eureka. With [Spring CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html) (and [Spring Cloud pluging](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-cli/)) is very easy. Note, with the latest version I had problems, I am using here earlier versions.

```bash
$ spring --version
Spring CLI v2.0.8.RELEASE
$ spring cloud --version
Spring Cloud CLI v2.0.0.RELEASE
$ spring cloud eureka
```

Eureka will be available at `http:localhost:8761`

2. Start Kafka. With [Confluent CLI](https://docs.confluent.io/current/cli/index.html) is very easy. 

```bash
$ confluent start

This CLI is intended for development only, not for production
https://docs.confluent.io/current/cli/index.html

control-center is [UP]
ksql-server is [UP]
connect is [UP]
kafka-rest is [UP]
schema-registry is [UP]
kafka is [UP]
zookeeper is [UP]
```

The `Confluent Control Center` will be available at `http://localhost:9021`

3. Start the provided three Spring Boot services.

4. Access the `customer-service`

```bash
$ http :9090/customers/1
```

```json
{
    "_links": {
        "update-address": {
            "href": "http://localhost:9090/customers/1/address"
        }
    },
    "address": {
        "canton": "Zurich",
        "city": "Zurich",
        "postCode": "8045",
        "streetName": "Manessestrasse",
        "streetNr": "87"
    },
    "birthDate": "1983-03-08",
    "contract": {
        "products": [
            "Basic health insurance FAMILY_DOCTOR_MODEL --- CHF 295.6",
            "Supplementary outpatient insurance PLUS --- CHF 19.6",
            "Supplementary hospital insurance HOSPITA_FLEX --- CHF 9.4",
            "Supplementary dental insurance DENTAL --- CHF 26.0",
            "Legal expenses insurance in health matters PROTECT --- CHF 1.5"
        ],
        "validFrom": "2017-01-03"
    },
    "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
    "gender": "MALE",
    "mobile": "+4111223344",
    "name": "John Doe"
}
```

This service is calling under the hood the `product-service` when constructing the `contract` field

4. Access the `contract-service`

```bash
$ http :9091/contracts\?customerId=1
```

```json
{
    "customerId": 1,
    "id": "cae37dd9-7661-4ad3-a097-5a5a0ff51060",
    "products": [
        {
            "deductible": 2500,
            "description": "If youâ€™re ill, always go to your chosen family doctor first.",
            "id": "5a5b9cc1-5d3d-46c8-8035-e7b216190bc6",
            "isBasic": true,
            "name": "Basic health insurance",
            "price": 295.6,
            "type": "FAMILY_DOCTOR_MODEL",
            "withAccidentCover": false
        },
        {
            "description": "Basic supplementary insurance for preventative measures, spectacles, sport and more",
            "id": "149dda72-b3e2-4a8b-9d2c-02aa9c684f17",
            "name": "Supplementary outpatient insurance",
            "price": 19.6,
            "type": "PLUS"
        },
        {
            "description": "Multiple occupancy rooms across Switzerland",
            "id": "185be201-58cb-47a2-a894-a112697d405c",
            "name": "Supplementary hospital insurance",
            "price": 9.4,
            "type": "HOSPITA_FLEX"
        },
        {
            "description": "Coverage 50%, max. CHF 1000",
            "id": "ddf646c5-7403-4d04-82e2-f516c426c323",
            "name": "Supplementary dental insurance",
            "price": 26.0,
            "type": "DENTAL"
        },
        {
            "description": "Protection in legal disputes with medical service providers regarding health insurance",
            "id": "369cff66-e4c7-4f46-9527-6862b1e403db",
            "name": "Legal expenses insurance in health matters",
            "price": 1.5,
            "type": "PROTECT"
        }
    ],
    "validFrom": "2017-01-03"
}
```

5. Update the customer's address using: (see the `update-address` link in the `customers/1` response)

```bash
$ echo '{
        "city": "Bern",
        "postCode": "3011",
        "streetName": "Seilerstrasse",
        "streetNr": "6",
        "canton":"Bern"
    }' | http patch :9090/customers/1/address
```

```bash
HTTP/1.1 202
```

This triggers and `AddressUpdateEvent` which is sent to `product-service` via messaging (using Kafka). Check the logs of `product-service` 

```bash

2019-03-06 22:10:39.854  INFO 50847 --- [container-0-C-1] c.m.l.AddressUpdateProcessor             : processing event AddressUpdateEvent(customerId=1, currentAddress=AddressUpdateEvent.Address(streetName=Manessestrasse, streetNr=87, postCode=8045, city=Zurich, canton=Zurich), newAddress=AddressUpdateEvent.Address(streetName=Seilerstrasse, streetNr=6, postCode=3011, city=Bern, canton=Bern))
